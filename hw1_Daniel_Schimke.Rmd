```

This homework is more or less a tutorial that helps you set up the coding environment used in this course, and familiarizes you with the format of the assignment submission. 
As a pre-requisite of this homework, first install R, and then the RStudio (the free version of Rstudio Desktop). 

Please respond to all questions. If the question asks you to do something on your laptop and you have finished that, just say "Done". 

1. Create a folder named `ds202_hw1`, and **either** create an RMarkDown file `hw1_FirstName_LastName.Rmd` under this folder **or** move the provided template into this folder. 
Replace `FirstName` and `LastName` with your first and last name. 
`hw1_FirstName_LastName.Rmd` will include your solutions. The file and folder names are *case-sensitive*, which means `hw1.Rmd` and `HW1.rmd` are different. *It is crucial to follow the exact folder structure and file names* in this course, so that your homework can be reproduced. The correct folder structure is

    ```
    ds202_hw1
    |-- hw1_FirstName_LastName.Rmd
    |-- hw1_FirstName_LastName.html (generated after knitting)
    ```
    
    Answer: Done? (Note that the start of your answer on the next line must be indented. In other words, don't remove the leading spaces.)
    Done

2. Write your name in the YAML of your homework `Rmd` file.

    Answer: Done

3. Write a paragraph to introduce yourself. Set your name in bold font and your major in italic. 

    Answer: Hello! I am **Daniel Schimke** and I am a junior majoring in *Software Engineering*. I am excited to begin learning in this class and am hoping to get as much as possible out of this semester. Data science is a topic that I am interested in an hope to include it in my future career as much as possible. Outside of my coursework, I love animals and always try to find ways to be around and interact with them more. I also love soccer, whether it be watching it or playing it. It is something that I have always had an interest in and I'm hoping that this class can help me get a more in depth and scientific perspective on some aspects of the sport.
  
4. Write a paragraph describing a job that you think is related to data science. Include a hyperlink and an image. Make sure your answer is in a nice format to read. 

    Answer: I found a job description for a job at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN called a Principal Data Science Analyst - Quantitative Health Services. This job entails working with large sums of data to try to find new patterns and insights in an attempt to have a positive impact on patients' health. This job is heavy in AI, machine learning, deep learning, regression techniques, neural networks, and many more advanced data science concepts. More information regarding this job can be found here https://jobs.mayoclinic.org/jobs/principal-data-science-analyst-quantitative-health-sciences-158015br/. ![](Job.png)
  
5. What data topic will you be most interested in? (Optional) Provide a source of such dataset if you have.

    Answer: Sports is one of the areas that I am interested in to study further. I find it interesting to apply data science techniques to my life and help increase my understanding of sports as well as data science practices as a whole. 
  
6. To check that your R and Rstudio installation is correct, find the version of R by entering `version` into the R console. Include this command into a R code trunk in your solution `Rmd` file to have it automatically printed in the knitted html file. 

    Answer:
```{r}
version
```
    
  
7. Install git. 
    - If you are on Windows: 
        a. Install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/). In the coming weeks we will use the Git Bash (but not the Git GUI). 
        b. After installation, set up Rstudio to use Git bash as the shell for the Terminal: Open RStudio, click Tools--Global Options--Terminal; under **Shells**, select Git Bash; click OK. 
        c. In the main menu of RStudio: click Tools--Terminal--New Terminal. If you have a `$` before your prompt, then you should be good to go.
        d. If you don't see a `$` before your prompt, try restarting RStudio.
    - If you are on Linux or macOS, Git has probably been installed by default, so you do not need to install anything. Just click the Terminal tab (above the R Console).

    Answer: Done
  
8. What is the version of your Git? To find out, go to the Terminal tab in RStudio (right to the Console tab), and type in the following command. If it works, this shows that the setup of your terminal and Git is correct. 
<!-- Then explore the bash command line and Git. -->

    ```
    git --version
    ```

    Answer: git version 2.26.2.windows.1
  
9. Configure your git username and user email by modifying and entering the following commands into the terminal

    ```
    git config --global user.name "your first and last name"
    git config --global user.email "your email"
    ```

    Answer: Done
  

10. Register a [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account. What is your username?

    Answer: dschimke
